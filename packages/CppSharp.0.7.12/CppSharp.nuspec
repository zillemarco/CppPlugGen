    <description>CppSharp is a collection of libraries for working with C++ code from high-level languages.

It has multiple use cases, from parsing C++ code to automatically generating bindings for wrapping C/C++ native code allowing interoperability with high-level languages. The supported target languages at present are C# (hence the name of the project) and C++/CLI.

This can be used to consume an existing native library in your high-level code or add scripting support to a native codebase.

The NuGet version is Windows 64-bit only for the time being. Binary 32-bit releases for Windows can be found at https://github.com/mono/CppSharp/releases .</description>
